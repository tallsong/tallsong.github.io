# Essence of algebra

## what is a Vector
### vector addition



how does it work in math

```math
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 + y_1 \\ x_2 + y_2 \end{bmatrix}

```



imagine it as a motion in axes. it first move to location1 then move to location2, the result is the end of the move, which means the result can be calculated separately for x and y.
