when I chose job, I'd like to:
- do something that I value of, whici I thinking they are cool and have an impact on the world.
- do the interesting thing with excellent colleagues
- in a position should allow me to analyze and solve problems, rather than being a job with clear-cut solutions.
- in an English-speaking environment.
- high salary, at least four times the rent.
