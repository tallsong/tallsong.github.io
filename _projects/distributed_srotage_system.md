# Background
In the cyber range, we may generate thousands of virtual machines or containers Within a short time, we need a storage system to store all the stuff(eg. Vm file, image file, software kit). So I just deploy and maintain a storage system via CEPH,  however, it doesn't support GUI operation, So I develop a web system that provides GUI to operate the support the storage system.
